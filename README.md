# logrank
Log-rank test with C++. 

Main code is logrank.cpp in which log-rank statistics is implemented. It depends only on standard library such as STL. 

logrank_test.cpp is a simple test program of logrank.cpp with pre-calculated logrank statistics with Graphad Prism. The data file
is in data.zip, therefore, unarchive data.zip before executing logrank_test program. 

All codes have been tested on CentOS 6.6 with gcc 4.4.7.
